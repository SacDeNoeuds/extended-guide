## Foreword ‚Äì What these guides do NOT address

This guide focuses on **client-side applications**. Whether you _need_ one or not is for you to decide. **Choose wisely**.<br>
In any case, using the model view approach is compatible with advanced techniques like server-side rendering if need be.

## Introduction

The model-view approach applies to any client-side application, precisely by decoupling behavior (model) and UI (view).<br>
Conceptually the model-view pattern is simple, yet diving into it is trickier than it seems IMO, which is why I am writing these series.

There are different flavors, AKA level of details one put in their model, therefore I‚Äôll give mine straight away: To me, the model is about data and behavior _only_, as a result there are no CSS classes or UI-related data in there.

Basically, **the model should contain 2 things only**:

- Data to be displayed
- Interactions, in the shape of functions/methods.

The data will change over time, therefore most of the data will be reactive.

## Get Started

Head to [Json Placeholder API setup](./1-json-api.md).

I hope you will enjoy this series,<br>
Have a nice journey üëã
