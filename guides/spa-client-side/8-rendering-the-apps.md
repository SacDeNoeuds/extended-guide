# Rendering our React & Vue apps

## The HTML

I will use an HTML select to choose between Vue & React, and re-render upon select change.

<!-- include [code:html] ./spa-client-side/index.html -->

## The rendering process

We will create a function for each engine: React & Vue, and another one to switch between the engines.

<!-- include [code:ts] ./spa-client-side/render-app-8.ts -->

## The entry point â€“Â main.ts

Now our main is very simple: we get the value from the select and render the corresponding app.

When the select value changes, we re-render the app.

<!-- include [code:ts] ./spa-client-side/main.ts -->

## Testing the whole thing

```sh
npm start
```

Tada ðŸŽ‰
