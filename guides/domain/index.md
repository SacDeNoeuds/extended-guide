## OOP, that traitor

To me, Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm imported by the video game industry because it suited them there. But it does not suit regular business in my opinion.

I can endure the immutability performance overhead in exchange for predictability and peace of mind. The trade-off is easily made.

Yet, because OOP is such a major standard and TypeScript adoption is young (in comparison), there is not much documentation regarding how to model a system in TypeScript using function/data-oriented programming.

That is the subject of this guide. How about we [get started](./1-branded-types.md)?
