# Authentication

What if I told youâ€¦ we do not need middlewares when we have dependency inversion?

Here is how it will work:

```ts
type Authenticate = (headers: Headers) => Promise<Account>
// The trick is to throw a Response 401 if unauthenticated ðŸ˜‰
// Because you know, `throw` was actually made to interrupt a flowâ€¦
```

## Implementing the `authenticate` factory

I will voluntarily use an `authenticate` factory function to emulate that we inject a persistence layer.

<!-- include [code:tsx] ./server-first/5-authentication/authenticate.tsx -->

## Updating the greet handler to use `authenticate`

<!-- diff [code:ts] ./server-first/5-authentication/greet-handler.tsx ./server-first/4-support-body-schema/greet-handler.tsx -->

## Unit testing the greet handler

<details>
<summary>Spec file</summary>

<!-- include [code:ts] ./server-first/5-authentication/greet-handler.spec.ts -->

</details>

```sh
âœ“ server-first/5-authentication/greet-handler.spec.ts (3)
   âœ“ greetHandler â€“ with authentication (3)
     âœ“ fails with 400 when no authorization provided
     âœ“ fails with 400 when authorization is incorrect
     âœ“ responds with 200 & a blue div
```

## Update the server

<!-- diff [code:ts] ./server-first/5-authentication/server.ts ./server-first/4-support-body-schema/server.ts -->

## End-to-End Testing

```sh
npx tsx ./src/server-first/5-authentication/server.ts
```

Letâ€™s test our various use cases:

```sh
$ curl 'http://localhost:6600/hello'

{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "stack": [
    "Error",
    "at createError (/Users/petite-crapouille/workspace/sacdenoeuds/extended-guide/node_modules/h3/dist/index.cjs:85:15)",
    "at Server.toNodeHandle (/Users/petite-crapouille/workspace/sacdenoeuds/extended-guide/node_modules/h3/dist/index.cjs:2279:21)",
    "at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)"
  ]
}
```

Oopsie! Maybe our adapter needs to be updatedâ€¦

## Updating the H3 adapter

<!-- diff [code:ts] ./server-first/5-authentication/h3-adapter.ts ./server-first/4-support-body-schema/h3-adapter.ts -->

## End-to-End Testing, Again

```sh
# With no auth
$ curl 'http://localhost:6600/hello'
<div style="color: red">We donâ€™t know youâ€¦</div>
# ðŸŽ‰

# With incorrect auth
$ curl -H 'authorization: Toto' 'http://localhost:6600/hello'
<div style="color: red">We donâ€™t know youâ€¦</div>
# âœ…

# With correct auth
$ curl -H 'authorization: John' 'http://localhost:6600/hello'
<div style="color: blue">Hello, John</div>
# âœ…
```

All good, we can move on to the next piece!
