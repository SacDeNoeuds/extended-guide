## Introduction

> [!WARNING]
> ⚠️ These series are still work-in-progress 🚧

Let’s start with 2 definitions – yes, they come from me 🤓:

> **Web Platform**: A technology which decided to **never introduce breaking changes**.<br>
> **Web Framework**: A technology which **introduce breaking changes ~ once every 2 to 5 years**.

If I rephrase that:<br>
Let’s say you are working at a company whose first project was bootstrapped 3 or 5 years ago. What are the chances that you have migrated – or need to migrate – one of your frameworks?

To me it’s near 100%. In that way, the JavaScript world is particularly contradictory:

1. The **web platform** decided at its very beginning it would **never introduce breaking changes**. Websites from the 2000s are still up & running!<br>Although it may have some drawbacks (like keeping `null` and `undefined` 😒), this **philosophy drove trust**, thus **wide adoption**.
2. The **web frameworks**, on the contrary, have introduced _countless_ breaking changes, inducing migrations and impacted teams on their way to delivering features, therefore driving less revenue. Either that or your framework is too newbie 😄.

Because the **web platform** is so stable and gaining tons of features, I want to bet on it.

The worst bet I am making now is using TypeScript, considering it is on the verge to became an actual web standard.

## A bit of background

**Over my _first_ 5 years** as web developer, I went through 3+ big migrations ; migrations which takes something like weeks or months … on the web platform that **never introduces breaking changes**, WTF ??

Then I got into some architecture "good practices" like inversion of control to abstract away stuff like databases. you may recognize by names like "Repository", "Stores", "Clean Architecture", "Hexagonal Architecture", "Domain-Driven Design", ….

It has proven to work fine. Then I figured: could we apply these kind of practices for frameworks too? How hard would it be? So I tried.

That was the starting point of re-thinking web development at project-level, and I asked myself:
- What if I could migrate my frontend framework in days?
- What if I could migrate my backend framework in one function?

This series is the result of my experiments.

My thinking led me to other understandings regarding web project in general, see below if you are interested.

<details>
<summary><strong>How I would web project now</strong></summary>

So far, I identified 2 families of web projects: **local-first** and **server-first**.<br>
**Local-first** matches needs for offline capacities, which incidentally allows to port websites to mobile apps – and vice-versa.<br>
**Server-first** matches any other project. Here I am especially finger-pointing back-offices.

Bare in mind that local-first and server-first can also be *combined*. You may have server-first website for a back-office ***and*** a local-first app under a sub-path.<br>
In any case, a unit of business (business rules, domain, …) should exist in one place only: server-side for server-first ; client-side for local-first – you better trust your client devices ⚠️.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a special case for event-sourcing, I will not dig into that for 2 reasons:
> 1. It’s a rabbit hole subject
> 2. It’s – at the moment – way out my league.

I would argue – now – that server-first should be the default.<br>
If I rephrase that: you should have an **extremely good reason** to start a single-page app project, offline needs is one of them.

</details>

## What the dep? The ones I worry about

An IT project will have frontends (web/mobile apps), backends, databases, potentially in different languages. Which means we start this game with already our share of major upgrades:
- Language upgrades
- Database upgrades
- OS upgrades (my linux server from 18.04 to 20.04 then 22.04, …)
- Provider plan changes
- Development tool upgrades: vite/rollup/TypeScript/Capacitor/Netlify/CloudflareWorkers/GCP/…

That already represent a certain amount of maintenance work, doesn’t it?

My main goal now is to diminish the number of other major – breaking – upgrades I will encounter. For that I have a few strategies.

### Red flags 🚩

#### 🚩 1. _diminish as much as possible_ the number of dependencies

It seems obvious, but I still see some projects where `object-assign` or `pad-left` are installed.

#### 🚩 2. Avoid framework satellites

vue-\*, react-\*, express-\*, you get the drill.

Routing or i18n do not require Vue nor React.<br>
Parsing a request body does not require Express nor Fastify.<br>
I could go on for a while.

Any library like this you install will couple you further to the parent framework: The parent framework has a major version release? Your satellite library will have one too. 2+ major upgrades for the price of 1, yey 🙌

There is **no good reason to install a framework satellite**, hiding behind ~the ease of use~ your laziness will not help.

Bottom line: favor framework-agnostic libraries, best-in-class are those with adapters like fullcalendar, body-parser, i18next/FormatJS/Fluent, floating-ui, etc….

#### 🚩 3. Avoid libraries bringing their own standards

`fp-ts`, `effect`, `ramda`, `Angular`, `NestJS`, etc… Using such libraries makes you _completely_ tied to them by giving capabilities other libs don’t. That is their key to keep you in ; There’s no going back.

Abstractions are good but favor your own, or smaller ones. Unless you facade everything, creating your own std library with a patchwork of tools, why not.

### Yellow flags ⚠️

#### ⚠️ 1. Native APIs duplicates

The web platform is improving super fast, making some (parts of) libraries stale: lodash, underscore, MoutJS, Ramda, BigJS (-> bigint), …

To fill web platform gaps, favor polyfills if possible (see polyfill.io), smaller libraries otherwise (like [just-*](https://github.com/angus-c/just) collection).

#### ⚠️ 2. Lots of major versions in short amount of time

Check out the npm `versions` tab. Why: I don't want to be dependent on someone changing their mind. React I look at you, but not only.

Let’s compare:

React has released 4 major versions in 9 years (completely changing paradigms twice).<br>
Vue has released 3 major versions in 9 years.<br>
Svelte has released 5 major versions in 8 years (changing completely paradigms for v5).<br>
Solid has released 1 major version in 3 years.

i18next has released 24 major versions in 11 years.<br>
@formatjs/intl has released 3 major versions in 4 years.<br>

This gives you an idea of the pace.

These numbers should only serve as warnings, make the decision by reading Migration Guides and/or changelogs..

1. Breaking changes are overall anecdotic -> ✅.
2. Breaking changes include paradigms shifts **once** -> ⚠️, check for how long the last shift has lasted.
3. Breaking changes include paradigms shifts **more than once** -> big ⚠️.
4. No changelog nor migration guide -> 🚩.

#### ⚠️ 3. Libraries encouraging hard-to-test code practices

For instance: tanstack query or form, 😒. When I look at their usage, there’s no way to test anything outside the framework world ; Big 🟡 flag.

### Final word: we will need dependencies

That being said, we cannot avoid installing some of those dependencies.
However, we can **chose** framework-free dependencies. This is a pre-requisite to be able to use frameworks in a decoupled way.

## Get Started

For demo purposes, we will build a collaborative Todo product. Before anything, we will [model our product]() (if you are interested in Domain-Driven Design) by defining entities and use cases. Then here’s the roadmap:
- [Building the product using the server-first approach](./server-first/index.md) – AKA multi-page app
- [Building the product using the local-first approach](./spa-client-side/index.md) – AKA single-page app

The cool thing about this project is that both approaches are relevant, it all goes down to your expectations.

I hope you will enjoy this series,<br>
Have a nice journey 👋
