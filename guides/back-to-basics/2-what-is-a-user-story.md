# What is a User Story? ✍️

## What they are for

The serve agility and planning purposes:

- Be able to develop when requirements change often.
- They are a way of remembering that a piece of work _might_ need to be done, without committing to actually doing it, or diving into the details too soon.
- Create a discussions: customer/company, product/developers, etc.
- Drive the creation of acceptance tests

## The Connextra template

The emerging standard.

1. The **feature** that needs to be discussed
2. The **role** that will get the benefit from the feature
3. The **benefit** that is expected

> As a **_type of user_** – the role<br>
> I want **_capability_** – the feature<br>
> So that **_business value_** - the benefit

## Examples

#### Listing the members of a team:

> **As** a team member
>
> **I want** to check my teammates contact info
>
> **So that** I can contact them in case of emergency

Here appears the question "why would a team member check their teammates' contact info?". This question is important by just rising, because if you do not find any valid reason (hence business value), then you do not build such a feature. Time saved, yey!

#### Managing a team (adding/removing members):

> **As** a team admin
>
> **I want** to manage my team
>
> **So that** I am autonomous and do not need to spam support
