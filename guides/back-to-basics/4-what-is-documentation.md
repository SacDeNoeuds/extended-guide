# What is documentation? ðŸ“–

It goes down to its **purpose: Sharing knowledge with other people** (or our future self).

Then we have to adopt various strategies depending on 2 criteria:

## 1. How long will the knowledge be fresh?

<small>Paraphrasing folks from _living documentation_ here</small>

A certain knowledge will stay true/valid for a certain time. We can roughly split into big categories:

- **Constant knowledge** (or almost constant), stays valid for a long time.
  - Someoneâ€™s birth date _never_ changes.
  - Someoneâ€™s first name will change very rarely during their life.
  - The name of a country, very few changes in history.
- **Often-changing knowledge**
  - Someoneâ€™s home
  - Someoneâ€™s tastes or job
  - Presidents in countries holding elections every 5 years
- **Ever-changing knowledge**
  - Someoneâ€™s age
  - Someoneâ€™s income
  - The location of a function in the codebase

#### 2. Who is this knowledge for â€“ Target audience

If I take the example of the IT world, it can be other developers and/or business people, let's recap the audience (non exhaustive list):

- Developers
- QA
- Product owners/managers
- Customer success/relationship managers.
- Sales (business people)
- Marketing (business people)
- C-level
