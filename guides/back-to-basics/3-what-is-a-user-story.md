## What they are for

Agility and planning:

- Be able to develop when requirements change often.
- They are a way of remembering that a piece of work _might_ need to be done, without committing to actually doing it, or diving into the details too soon.
- Create a discussions: customer/company, product/developers, etc.
- Drive the creation of acceptance tests

## The Connextra template

The emerging standard.

1. The **feature** that needs to be discussed
2. The **role** that will get the benefit from the feature
3. The **benefit** that is expected

> As a **_type of user_** – the role<br>
> I want **_capability_** – the feature<br>
> So that **_business value_** - the benefit
