## Back to basics

Before we dive into anything, let’s go back to basics and question the obvious, because nothing is as poorly defined as the obvious, everyone having their unconscious assumptions.

When was the last time you asked yourself:

- What is a bug?
- What is a feature?
- What is a use case?

I am convinced clarifying those concepts is worth the detour.

As an introduction, I will question the easiest one:

### What is a bug?

Simple, isn’t it? It is something not working as expected. Which brings the question "[What is a feature?](./1-what-is-a-feature.md)"
