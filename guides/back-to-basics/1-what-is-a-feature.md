# What is a feature? âœ¨

Understand "feature" as a "trait" or "characteristic" of our programs. That being said, the concept is still blurry. Letâ€™s take examples:

- is "_listing the members of a team_" a feature? Thatâ€™s a bit too shallowâ€¦
- is "_removing a team member from the team_" a feature? Well, still too shallow.

To have a clearer view, behavior-driven development can help us. Picture those [Cucumber/Gherkin examples](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/better-gherkin):

```gherkin
Feature: Subscribers see different articles based on their subscription level
Scenario: Free subscribers see only the free articles
  â€¦
Scenario: Subscriber with a paid subscription can access both free and paid articles
  â€¦
```

Now the mist is fading. Letâ€™s break down our feature, we want to be able to:

- list team members
- add team members
- remove team members

Is "listing team members" sufficient on its own? Letâ€™s say the business says "Well, team members can view the list, but only admins can edit the list".

There we have our features:

- Viewing team members
- Managing a team.

```gherkin
Feature: View team members
  Scenario: Get the list of team members
    â€¦

Feature: An admin can manage their teams
  Scenario: Add a new team member
    â€¦
  Scenario: Remove an existing team member
    â€¦
```

## Anatomy of a feature

So it appears a feature is structured this way:

```txt
FeatureÂ â€“ View team members
â””â”€â”€ Scenario #1 â€“ List team members
FeatureÂ â€“ Admin can manage their teams
â”œâ”€â”€ Scenario #2 â€“ Add team member
â””â”€â”€ Scenario #3 â€“ Remove team member
```

Here it becomes obvious to me that `Scenario` is the exact synonym of `Use Case`.

## The 5 aspects of a feature

### 1. Behavior

A few examples of behavior â€“ or constraints:

- Should I be able to add team-member from outside the company?
- Is there a limit to how many members a team can have?

### 2. Usability

You have a feature and thatâ€™s beautiful. Where is it exposed? A few examples:

- API route
- UI: Website, ChatBot, â€¦
- CLI command (unlikely, here)
- Voice interface (Alexa, Google Home, â€¦)

### 3. Compatibility

The code has to be able to run somewhere, ideally in as many runtimes as possible.
Some code will work only on NodeJS, Erlang VM, evergreen browsers, etc.

### 4. Performance

The code should be executed in a reasonable amount of time. This can be measured at various levels:

- Scenario test
- API route test
- Front-end rendering test
- End-to-end test

### 5. Security

We have to make sure that our features or invulnerable to SQL injections or XSS for instance.
Where to test that? It depends, sorry.

## Full dive

The number of scenarios can rapidly grow ðŸ˜….

```gherkin
Feature: Get a list of team members
  As a team member
  I want to see my teammates
  So that I can contact them in case of emergency

  Background:
    Given Mary is an A-team admin
    And Jack is an A-team member
    And Bob is a B-team member

  Scenario: A team member check the list of their teammates
    When Mary checks the A-team's members
    Then she sees Mary and Jack
    And it took less than 500ms # a demo of how to include performance testing

  Scenario: A team member fails checking another team's members
    When Bob checks the A-team's members
    Then Bob sees a "Not Found" error
```

And for admins:

```gherkin
Feature: An admin can manage their teams
  As a team admin
  I want to manage my team
  So that I am autonomous and do not need to spam support

  Background:
    Given Mary is an A-team admin
    And Jack is an A-team member
    And Bob is a B-team member

  Scenario: A team admin adds a new team member
    When Mary adds Bob
    Then the list contains Mary, Jack and Bob
    And it took less than 500ms # a demo of how to include performance testing

  Scenario: A team admin removes an existing team member
    When Mary removes Jack
    Then the list does not contain Jack
    But the list contains Mary

  Scenario: A team admin promotes a member as admin
    When Mary promotes Jack as team admin
    Then Jack becomes an A-team admin

  Scenario: A team admin revokes admin rights of a member
    When Mary promotes Jack as team admin
    And Mary revokes Jack's admin rights
    Then Jack is still an A-team member

  # Limitations
  Scenario: A team must have 1+ admin
    When Mary is the only team admin
    And Mary revokes Mary's admin rights
    Then Mary sees a "cannot remove last admin" error

  Scenario: A team admin adds a non-existent team member
    When Mary adds Freddy
    Then Mary sees an "unknown person" error

  Scenario: A team admin removes a non-existing team member
    When Mary removes Bob
    Then the list still contains Mary and Jack

  # Access control
  Scenario: A non-admin cannot add a new team member
    When Bob or Jack adds a new team member
    Then he sees a "Forbidden" error

  Scenario: A non-admin cannot remove a team member
    When Bob or Jack removes a team member
    Then he sees a "Forbidden" error
```
