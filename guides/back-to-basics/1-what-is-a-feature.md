# What is a feature? âœ¨

Understand "feature" as a "trait" or "characteristic" of our programs. That being said, the concept is still blurry. Letâ€™s take examples:

- is "_listing the members of a team_" a feature? Thatâ€™s a bit too shallowâ€¦
- is "_removing a team member from the team_" a feature? Well, still too shallow.

To have a clearer view, behavior-driven development can help us. Picture those [Cucumber/Gherkin examples](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/better-gherkin):

```gherkin
Feature: Subscribers see different articles based on their subscription level
Scenario: Free subscribers see only the free articles
  â€¦
Scenario: Subscriber with a paid subscription can access both free and paid articles
  â€¦
```

Now the mist is fading. Letâ€™s break down our feature, we want to be able to:

- list team members
- add team members
- remove team members

Is "listing team members" sufficient on its own? Letâ€™s say the business says "Well, team members can view the list, but only admins can edit the list".

There we have our features:

- Viewing team members
- Managing a team.

```gherkin
Feature: View team members
  Scenario: Get the list of team members
    â€¦

Feature: An admin can manage their teams
  Scenario: Add a new team member
    â€¦
  Scenario: Remove an existing team member
    â€¦
```

## Anatomy of a feature

So it appears a feature is structured this way:

```txt
FeatureÂ â€“ View team members
â””â”€â”€ Scenario #1 â€“ List team members
FeatureÂ â€“ Admin can manage their teams
â”œâ”€â”€ Scenario #2 â€“ Add team member
â””â”€â”€ Scenario #3 â€“ Remove team member
```

Here it becomes obvious to me that `Scenario` is the exact synonym of `Use Case`.

## The 5 aspects of a feature

### 1. Behavior

A few examples of behavior â€“ or constraints:

- Should I be able to add team-member from outside the company?
- Is there a limit to how many members a team can have?

### 2. Usability

You have a feature and thatâ€™s beautiful. Where is it exposed? A few examples:

- API route
- UI: Website, ChatBot, â€¦
- CLI command (unlikely, here)
- Voice interface (Alexa, Google Home, â€¦)

### 3. Compatibility

The code has to be able to run somewhere, ideally in as many runtimes as possible.
Some code will work only on NodeJS, Erlang VM, evergreen browsers, etc.

### 4. Performance

The code should be executed in a reasonable amount of time. This can be measured at various levels:

- Scenario test
- API route test
- Front-end rendering test
- End-to-end test

### 5. Security

We have to make sure that our features are invulnerable to SQL injections or XSS for instance.
Where to test that? It depends, sorry.

## Who is responsible of which aspect?

| Aspect                             | Who is responsible                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Behavior](#_1-behavior)           | All stakeholders:<br>- Developers<br>- Product owners (if any)<br>- QA (if any)<br>- **Customers** (if any ðŸ¤­) |
| [Usability](#_2-usability)         | Developers & Designers (for UIs)                                                                               |
| [Compatibility](#_3-compatibility) | Developers                                                                                                     |
| [Performance](#_4-performance)     | Developers & DevOps                                                                                            |
| [Security](#_5-security)           | Developers & DevOps                                                                                            |

Compatibility, performance and security involve exclusively technical people. Any bug on those are developers/devops shortcomings or mistakes.

However, behavior is the only aspect involving business stakeholders, because it is the part bringing the business value.

To build great features full business value â€“ and prevent behavior from going hazardous â€“, we can rely on [User Stories](./2-what-is-a-user-story.md).
