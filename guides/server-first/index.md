## Introduction

I will not try to model _exactly_ what a server is. A lot of people â€“ very likely waaay smarter than IÂ â€“ already did an extraordinarily good job at this: check out the [Open API](https://swagger.io/docs/) collective if you are interested. But beware you will still get cruel migrations ðŸ˜… (OpenAPI is v3 at the time of writing).

I will focus solely on what matters to _our_ situation: modeling a server containing _only_ HTML route handlers.
